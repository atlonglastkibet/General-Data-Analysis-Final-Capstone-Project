# Final General Data Analysis Capstone Project

Welcome to the repository for my final General Data Analysis Capstone Project. Below, you will find an overview of the resources and tools I used to complete this project, along with links to the publicly accessible components.

## Data Source
The dataset used for this project is publicly available and can be accessed through the following link:
- [TidyTuesday Dataset (2021-01-19)](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2021/2021-01-19/readme.md)

## Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD)
To visualize the relationships between entities within the dataset, I created an Entity-Relationship Diagram using Lucidchart. You can view the diagram using the link below:
